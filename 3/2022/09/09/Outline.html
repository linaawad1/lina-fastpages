<p>Ideas for an app:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Games
    <ul>
      <li>classic games but prettier</li>
      <li>for example: Soduko but with something other than numbers and with personalized designs</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>With colors: try to fill the boxes with each color.</li>
      <li>The colors could include the rainbow, gray, and white</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Apps:
    <ul>
      <li>An app that will talk to you about advice and certain quotes that are customizable.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>for example, saying a name or a place in one of the pieces of advice can help the user 
feel more connected and helped by the app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
