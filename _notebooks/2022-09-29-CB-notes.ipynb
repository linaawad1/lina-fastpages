    "- Identify input(s) to a program.\n",
    "- Identify output(s) produced by a program.\n",
    "Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.\n",
    "- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.\n",
    "-  Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.\n",
    "-  Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program.\n",
    "Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:\n",
    "- tactile (touch), audio, visual, text (including numerical values)\n",
    "How do programs receive input?\n",
    "Most programs are written in an event driven environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Daily Video 3\n",
    "Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Explain how a program or code segment functions.\n",
    "Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "- A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.\n",
    "- A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.\n",
    "- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.\n",
    "- The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.\n",
    "- A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function.\n",
    "What is a program?\n",
    "A program is a collection of statements.\n",
    "- A statement is a single command, A group of statements is called a code segment, code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language, A program is often referred to as software.\n",
    "How can we describe this code segment?\n",
    "The description should:\n",
    "- Simply state what it does, so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program, include how it does what it does: by explaining in detail how the code segment functions\n",

    "\n",
    "Specific Purpose: Our purpose is to create a fun and slightly unique game that all of us enjoy and we think our users will use frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas/brainstorm: \n",
    "- A snake game\n",
    "- Instead of a snake it can be a person\n",
    "- We can personalize it to our interests: Running?\n",
    "- Mult-colored or an agreed upon color scheme\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Usable by any computer user\n",
    "- Uses the keys and resmebles the classic snake game\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Simple enough to design, \"do we have enough time?\"\n",
    "- Not too unoriginal\n",
    "Impact: It may bring joy to the users, however it may be distracting and harm the sturdents productiveness in the classroom\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in Mind:\n",
    "- Data Abstraction. UML is pictured in article. Think about how data will be formed and managed.\n",
    "- Managing Complexity. Think about frontend and backend portions of the system.\n",
    "- Procedural Abstraction. Design some of the key objects of the system. Think about the key elements of User Design. This should help you divide work amongst team. Effectually, you will be creating the sub systems of the system in this design effort.\n",
    "- Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of your project and its algorithms must be considered, prototyped early. This will help you understand capabilities of team and some of the longer/research required activities.\n",
    "- Testing. Be sure that you are performing iteration and testing as you go. Do not stack things up or integrate infrequently. Develop, Integrate, Test weekly!!! Also, think about the things that needs to be tested. Think about how to put data into the system auto magically to ensure quality is produced and everything is easily validated.\n"
