    "- Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages. \n",
    "- Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequencing is doing steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. \n",

    "Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. \n",

    "Must be in order:\n",

    "- algorithm- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration.\n",
    "- selection- a section of code is run only if a condition is met.\n",
    "- iteration- repeating steps or instructions over and over again\n",
    "- sequencing- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given\n",
    "- variable- you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call\n",
