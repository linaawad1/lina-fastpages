### Notes on Agile Methodology

- Scrum Master: facilitate the sprint, looking to improve group efficiency
- DevOps: philosophies and tools to increase velocity and the efficiency of our project
- Frontened Developer: the visual parts of the project the user interacts with
- Backened Developer: The background code nobody sees but is very important. Data storage, security, and other server-side functions.

Scrum Board: develop and understand everyone's ideas on a continuous basis

Sprint: 2 weeks of planning and executing work

7 Important Transferable Skills:

-CREATIVITY: Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you do both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems.

- CRITICAL THINKING: Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results.

- COMMUNICATION: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together.

- COLLABORATION THROUGH LEADERSHIP: Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions

- COLLABORATION-TEAMWORK: Individuals that work well with others. It applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity.

- RESEARCH: Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research.

- TECHNICAL: Need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment. Be knowledgeable about technical things that you are learning.
