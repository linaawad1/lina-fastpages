# My ideas for Performance Task

Ideas for an app:

1. Games
- classic games but prettier
- for example: Soduko but with something other than numbers and with personalized designs
     - With colors: try to fill the boxes with each color.
     - The colors could include the rainbow, gray, and white

2. Apps:
- An app that will talk to you about advice and certain quotes that are customizable.
   - for example, saying a name or a place in one of the pieces of advice can help the user 
   feel more connected and helped by the app.
