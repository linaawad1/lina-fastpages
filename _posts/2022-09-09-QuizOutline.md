# My Quiz Outline

Ideas for Quiz:

1. Make a cell phone layout to hold our quiz
2. Our lockscreen is a photo of Chris and Matt Sturniolo using the upload image feature and an open button
   - We also included details like the time and date
3. Our homescreen included a pretty picture of a sunset from the internet
4. From there we created a button that we designed to look like an app on a phone
5. Our first app was our quiz with 3 questions about the Sturniolo Triplets, Lydia's favorite drink, and my favorite ice cream flavor.
6. Then, when the user goes back to the homescreen they can clcik on the istagram app.
7. In the instagram app, it shows a picture of Lydia and I and a button called "load more"
8. If you click this button it takes you to Lydia's picture. If it's clicked it takes you to my pictures then to home.
9. The last app is a messaging app that shows a fake conversation between me and Lydia.
10. The last feature is a radio button that can take the user back to the lockscreen
11.That's our quiz!!!!
