<p>Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, we are thinking of making a computer game similar to snake with our personalized elements that make everyone included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not exactly, our purpose is to make a game for the enjoyment of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think so because we all agreed on the idea and how we want to have fun with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>It's kind of simple so it's not a revolutionary idea but it will have its 
specialties. However it won't need real customer or sponser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?</p>
<ul>
<li>If we pull it off and make it kind of unique it probably can be used for Create Performance Task Submission</li>
</ul>
