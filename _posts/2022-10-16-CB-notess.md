Errors and Correcting Errors:

1. Correct
- Interchanging lines 3 and 7 ensures that if reducing score by penalty results in a negative value, score is set to 0. Otherwise, score is reduced by penalty.

2. Incorrect
- I put: [-3, -2, -1]
- The answer: [-1, 0, 1]
- The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values.

3. Incorrect
- I put: 8 and 7 because I linked them together, I assumed they needed to be in the same description
- The answer: 8 and 6 because if 6 is inputted it will display check not check minus

The Internet:

1. Correct
- Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly.

2. Correct
- Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.

3. Incorrect
- The internet is not a data stream. Instead, the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.
