I took away the awe and inspirations from these designs. It was so cool and unique to me that it made me want to learn more about how they made these designs possible. I was also now hungry for some donuts.

### Stop 3: Studio Art

One of my friends showed me hers:

### Stop 4: Ceramics

Our last strop was ceramics!

I took ceramics last school year and I loved it. My favorite part was admiring what everyone did. This year, so many people's were so pretty and so creative. I could never.
