### Stop 1: APCSP

Me and Lydia looked at a variety of different CSP projects but the one I really liked the most was the online and called th DN market place:

This group made a website where you can type an item and the price you are "selling" it for and put it on an online shop. It was super unique and it was so fun to experience the website as someone just watching.

### Stop 2: 3D animation

WOW! Me and Lydia spent a good 10 minutes staring at the slideshow of the donuts. No joke.

This is one of them:

This is Lydia and I's reactions:

We thought these donut animations were so interesting and we spent a good amount of time in awe. SO COOL!

### Stop 3: Studio Art

SOOOO COOL. We walked around the studio art room admiring all the different art pieces and even the photography that was in the room.

One of my friends showed me hers:

When I asked her what inspired her she told me about the prompt to capture something personal. she chose the theme of the stages of grief. It was super cool what she did and everyone elses was so inspiring and pretty.

### Stop 4: Ceramics

Our last strop was ceramics!

I took ceramics last school year and I loved it. My favorite part was admiring what everyone did. This year, so many people's were so pretty and so creative. I could never.

Here are some good ones:


### What did I takeway?
I took away the awe and inspirations from these designs. It was so cool and unique to me that it made me want to learn more about how they made these designs possible. I was also now hungry for some donuts. All the art pieces were super cool and unique and I loved exposing myself to new things. It also lowkey made me want to draw something. All the themes for the AP Studio art were super fun and cool. Furthermore, it was just fun to see what other people's hard work got them and all the cool things people have to show for it.

Yay! Night @ the Museum Blog = Over
