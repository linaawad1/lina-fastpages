### Question 28

- My Answer: A
- Why did I choose this?
- I chose A because I thought that since it had separate conditions for under 25 and over 25, they are simply multiplied by either 5 or 7.
- Why was it wrong?
- The answer I chose would overprice the customer. This basically means that even though the price is different for every unit above 25, the original 25 units should not be charged 7, they should be charged 5.

- Right Answer: C
- Why?
- If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. When the customer buys 35 units they wouldn't pay 7 for all 35. They would by 35-25=10 units that were 7 and the 25 that are 5.

### Question 35

- My Answer: B and D
- Why did I choose this?
- I didn't exactly see the difference between A and B so I knew it was D. I chose B because I thought that if the code segment set MaxPS to 50 at the end it would be right additiona. I also chose D because it uses an if statement to comply to the conditions. It sets maxPS to 30 under > 120 and everything else would be 50.
- Why was it wrong?
- If it was answer B, it would be set to 50 regardless of the time or conditions that the question had originally asked for in the problem, so it isn't write.

- Right Answer: A and D
- Why?
- Answer A sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120. Answer D uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise.

### Question 36

- My Answer: D
- Why did I choose this?
- I chose this because I thought that if the APPEND command was after the first line it would mean that it was added and used in the code. So I thought it would replace the missing code.
- Why was it wrong?
- Because the code was initialized at 1, when the code segment I chose would have been initialized at zero for it to produce the right code that the problem wanted.

- Right Answer: C
- Why?
- "For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]"
- This was pulled from the college board suggestions but it is basically stating how having the APPEND statement first will give the list result that we wanted instead of the one I chose. So, the code segment would include 2 instead of 22.

### Question 38

- My Answer: C
- Why did I choose this?
- To be honest I don't know why I chose this. I probably assumed it was similar to the previour question so I followed the same format. 
- Why was it wrong?
- In reality, the second word doesn't change so it wouldn't be included in the code segment. Therefore it should not include the second or third line and add another as shown in answer B.

- Right Answer: B
- Why?
- Word1 becomes the temporary variable temp. Th word3 becomes word1. Ten word1, which is stored in temp, becomes word3. The original values of word1 and word3 are interchanged, and it produces the results shown in the table.
