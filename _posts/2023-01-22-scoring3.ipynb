Besides the written response, there was an obvious purpose and function within the actual program which is why I thought it may earn credit.|\n",
    "|Data Abstraction|0|0|Even though some of the requirements are met, the use of data abstraction doesn't directly impact the programs purpose/function. It may be defined, but it is not very program-specific.|\n",
    "|Managing Complexity|0|1|Due to the fact that it provided a reasonable depiction, I believed that it would manage complexity. But it isn't unique or specific. I t is wrong to claim that lists were useful and that the software could have been built differently if they hadn't been used.|\n",

    "- I had two overall discrepencies compared to the college board scorers. For one, I gave this submission a point for their purpose and function. I think that one thing you have to do as a grader is not assume anything and instead look for proof. If they don't clearly state program purpose and function I shouldn't create it for them. Also I gave them an unearned point for managing complexity. I should be on the lookout for submissions with lists that don't serve a specific purpose or are missing components.\n",

Everything should be clearly listed. I also need to make sure that the lists and code I add are relevant to the purpose and function of the overall program.\n",
