### The different errors I had with the api

- The post method was already defined in the users file that joselyn was editing so it gave me an error

### How I fixed it?

- I originally changed everything that said post into a placeholder but it caused problems later that I will discuss

### My problems with posting in postman

- I could not use the post method becuase I changed the post feature in my api
- When I deleted it for my api error it was not efficient and caused worse problems when I deleted or replaced what should not hvae been replaced.

### How I fixed it?

- I changed back the certain codes to say post for the post method
- I commented certain lines out of the code that had post but it wasn't important

### 500 Internal server error and 502 bad gateway

- I can't explain this because I am still not sure what is wrong
- It happened right after I tried to kill and restart our server.
- I still haven't fixed it and I need my server to work to connect the backend and the frontend.

### Frontend errors

- I had a 404 error when I clicked on the links in my dropdown
- My links were leading to the markdown but I didn't have a matching html link

### How I fixed it?

- I created a matching html link and I added it to my dropdown code segment with the href section for the different activities.

### Current Errors

- We still have a 502 gateway error
- My api was working yesterday but I recently changed something because the post method wasn't working
- But there is something wrong with my attributes that I have to fix
