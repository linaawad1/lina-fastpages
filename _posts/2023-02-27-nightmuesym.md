## Hi Welcome to my blog

Here is a link to all the images mentioned in this blog and even those not mentioned: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBALSVAUaAGofGTur8POgV4meJTg4e8c4GBf_TVAfAo/edit?usp=sharing

### Stop 1: APCSP

I looked at many projects from our class like the car dealership and the fluffy friends project. I also looked at my friends Dash's project.

- Dash's group created a website with several types of games that could be played on their own.
- It was super unique and it was so fun to experience the website as someone just watching.
- It also was fun to talk to other teams and experience their projects and all the hard work they have done.

### Stop 2: 3D animation

I really liked the 3D animation this trimester. I like all of their donut displays but one of my favorites showed some donuts at a dinner table.

- Me and my friends really likes these mostly because there was a lot of creativity and freedom in the different projects.
- My friends favorite was a donut shown in the dark and it was supeer dramatic.

### Stop 3: Studio Art

There were so many creative peices this trimester. I went with my friend who is in studio art and her pieces were super cool

- I reallu liked her picture of the fish because she has a really gentle touch and her purpose was very fun to see through her work
- I also liked some of the photos even though I didn't take pictures but they were super cool

### Stop 4: Ceramics

Another fun stop was ceramics!

I took ceramics last school year and I loved it. Everyones projects this year were super fun to look at. 

- My favorites were really detailed and super creative ideas. 
- I also saw an elephant and took a picture because I made an elephant teapot last year.

### Stop 5: Photo

This is one stop I didn't pay too much attention to last time we had a night at the meusem.

- My favorites were the ones about the dogs because I love dogs and they were adorable.
- My favorite, photo-wise, was the ones that had a pretty sky because it was beautifully captured.


### What did I takeway?

I took away a lot of inspiration from all the different classes. It is so cool to see what all the other classes worked on this tri while we were making our own projects. It is so crazy to me how people are able to be so creative in these different arts. I could never do what they do in their classes and I was very impressed with every class. I also was inspired by photo because it made me want to take more pictures of my pets and the sunsets.
