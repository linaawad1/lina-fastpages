<h1 id="my-quiz-outline">My Quiz Outline</h1>

<p>Ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a cell phone layout to hold our quiz</li>
  <li>Our lockscreen is a photo of Chris and Matt Sturniolo using the upload image feature and an open button
    <ul>
      <li>We also included details like the time and date</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Our homescreen included a pretty picture of a sunset from the internet</li>
  <li>From there we created a button that we designed to look like an app on a phone</li>
  <li>Our first app was our quiz with 3 questions about the Sturniolo Triplets, Lydia’s favorite drink, and my favorite ice cream flavor.</li>
  <li>Then, when the user goes back to the homescreen they can clcik on the istagram app.</li>
  <li>In the instagram app, it shows a picture of Lydia and I and a button called “load more”</li>
  <li>If you click this button it takes you to Lydia’s picture. If it’s clicked it takes you to my pictures then to home.</li>
  <li>The last app is a messaging app that shows a fake conversation between me and Lydia.</li>
  <li>The last feature is a radio button that can take the user back to the lockscreen
11.That’s our quiz!!!!</li>
</ol>
