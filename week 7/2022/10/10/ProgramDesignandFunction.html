<h3 id="program-purpose-and-function">Program Purpose and Function</h3>

<p>The purpose of our program is to create an enjoyable game that is age and user friendly. It will function as a computer game that is purely for entertainment purposes. Our game will resemble the popular computer game, Snake.</p>

<h3 id="data-abstraction">Data Abstraction</h3>

<p>A part of our Data complexity will be when the snake goes for its food/target it will need to be added to the snakes length and score. This is us adding data abstraction through a series of code that will make the program function for its purpose. The variable body is the body of the snake and it will represent the number of points the user acheived.</p>

<h3 id="managing-complexity">Managing Complexity</h3>

<p>The lists will manage complexity by keeping our code organized and minimize the individual variables. it will make adding stuff much easier and simpler.</p>

<h3 id="procedural-abstraction">Procedural Abstraction</h3>

<p>Our procedure abstraction will be the effect of the user using the arrow keys to make the snake move in different directions. This procedure will make the program a lot more accesible to users making the function of the design a lot easier to use.</p>

<h3 id="algorithm-inplementation">Algorithm Inplementation</h3>

<p>An iteration in our code will be continuous gain of points by the user as the snake develops and gets the target repeatedly. The sequencing of the snake will occur when the target is added to the head of the snake and adds on the ends.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>We will test our program by running the game and seeing how user friendly it really is. Also, by asking friends to use it and give feedback. The errors notice will show us what to fix.</p>
